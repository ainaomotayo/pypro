default port is 9200, can be set in config.yml
in theory type allows space but does not work with curl so forget it
update to new es: download and extract new version, copy over data dir, start

list indices: curl 'localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v'
get item: curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/session1/tweet/1'
bulk upload: curl -s -XPOST localhost:9200/_bulk --data-binary @FILENAME
delete index: curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/INDEXNAME/'
stats for docs in specific index: curl localhost:9200/INDEXNAME/_stats/docs/
index mappings (schema): curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/session1/_mapping'
type mappings: curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/INDEXNAME/_mapping/TYPENAME'
create mapping: curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/INDEXNAME' --data-binary @FILENAME

sometimes these commands might be shown as having “;echo” appended at the end.
