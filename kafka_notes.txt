to successfully connect, need to edit server.properties for kafka and set "advertised.host.name=IPADDRESS" where
IPADDRESS is the IP address of the host running the Kafka server.

no leader error:
rm /tmp/kafka
rm /tmp/zookeeper

to get fast emptying kafka:
log.retention.ms=5000
log.retention.check.interval.ms=10000
